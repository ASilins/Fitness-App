## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of getting the program setup.

First you have to set up directory where the program will be.
Open cmd and go to the directories location using this command

```shell
cd directoryName
```

To speed up the process you can also use forward slash '/' to go through multiple directories

```shell
cd directoryName/anotherDirecoryName
```

Clone this git repository in cmd
Note: When you have cloned the repository it will create a folder where all of the files are in there

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ASilins/SEP3-Project
```
